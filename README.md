## ðŸ“Œ About the Project
This project is an interactive API based on Dark Souls 1, developed to list all the gameâ€™s bosses, including details about their locations and the items they drop. Through a simple search input, users can quickly find and retrieve information about any boss.
Additionally, to provide an immersive experience, I implemented a 3D model of a warrior sitting around the game's bonfire. The model is fully interactive, allowing users to explore the 3D environment with ease.
